## Hello There!👋

I enjoy building things from the ground up, and I’m currently focused on observability and orchestration in applied AI/ML systems.

Currently, I put my spare time to built/maintain some tools which I use it as a part of my workflow:
- [**Orkes**](https://github.com/hfahrudin/orkes): A lightweight orchestration framework for LLM agents, no abstractions you don’t need, just clean logic that works.
- [**Flowkestra**:](https://github.com/hfahrudin/flowkestra): A Lightweight orchestrator for Machine Learning Experiments in your MLFlow environment.

In addition, I love exploring emerging technologies in the AI/ML space and integrating them into decent MVPs. I update my experimental repository from time to time with my latest findings. [[link]](https://github.com/hfahrudin/automation-labs) 

Always down to collaborate with curious minds. If you have an idea or just want to talk tech, hit me up!
