## Hello There!👋

I am an aspiring programming wizard with a passion for performant and orchestration, with the goal of bringing them into the world of applied AI/ML.

Currently, I put my spare to built/maintain some tools which I use it as a part of my workflow:
- [**Orkes**](https://github.com/hfahrudin/orkes): A lightweight orchestration framework for LLM agents, no abstractions you don’t need, just clean coordination logic that works.
- [**Flowkestra**:](https://github.com/hfahrudin/flowkestra): A Lightweight Orchestrator for Machine Learning Experiments in your MLFlow environment.

In addition, I love exploring emerging technologies in the AI/ML space and integrating them into decent MVPs. I update my experimental repositor from time to time with my latest findings. [[link]](https://github.com/hfahrudin/automation-labs) 

Always looking for fellow wizards to collaborate with. If you have an idea or just want to talk tech, hit me up!
